Hello community,
thrilled to announce that I updated my Web Portal plugin for Idempiere https://github.com/icreated/portal-api with new features and important improvements:

* OpenAPI first approach in development
* Automatic generated DTO models with openapi-generator maven plugin
* MapStruct converting between DTO and Idempiere Model
* Hibernate Validator for declarative OpenApi DTO validation

You can find more details in my blog that I created and it will be updating with new posts about my projects, new, features and improvements.
